# Overview of University Projects

This repository contains examples of the projects that I have worked on during my time at university.

The four folders contain the following work:
- Dissertation: This is my final year dissertation where I achieved a mark of 83%. My dissertation was a statistical project titled 'Long term behaviour of the Elo scores of time-homogeneous players'.
- Research Project: This is my third year mini dissertation which was on a topic of our choice. The report was titled 'Expected Goals in Football'
- Applied Statistics Project: This was a project I undertook during my third year module Applied Statistics. The project was analysing characteristics on wine.
- Additional Tasks: During my fourth year, as well learning the exam content for the modules, we also had to produce a small report on a topic outside the scope of the module.
