# Additional Tasks

During my fourth year, as well learning the exam content for the modules, we also had to produce a small report on a topic outside the scope of the module. The topic for number theory was on Gaussâ€™ Circle Problem and for Heuristic Optimisation it was on the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) Algorithm.
